          <h2>What this is:</h2>
          <p>Certain members of Congress and the NSA want to force companies to give the government special access to our data—such as by building security vulnerabilities into their products or giving the government the keys to unlock our encrypted data. These “backdoors” are ostensibly to help fight crime, but security experts worldwide agree that they’ll make the web less safe for all of us.</p>
          <p>It is not possible to weaken encryption or create secret backdoors for law enforcement without making those same vulnerabilities available to bad actors. These proposals jeopardize not just our private data, but the security of every technology that relies on data encryption—everything from hospital equipment to airplane navigation systems to ATMs.</p>
          <p> <strong>One voice could tilt the balance</strong> and convince Congress and the intelligence community that real security standards can't be compromised: President Obama.</p>
          <p>Sign the below petition to submit your signature electronically to the White House’s “We the People” site. Help us make this the most popular petition in the site's history.</p>

            <strong>Dear President Obama,</strong>
          </p>
          <p>Our safety and privacy depend on secure communications tools and technologies, like encryption. Encryption protects our conversations and our transactions. In some cases, it even saves lives.</p>
          <p>We urge you to publicly affirm your support for strong encryption, and reject any law or policy that would undermine our security. Please disavow legislation and other compulsory actions that would weaken encryption in order to compel government access to our private data. The government should not erode the security of our devices or applications, force companies to build secret security flaws or backdoors into their products, or access the keys to private data.</p>
         <p>The President’s own National Security Council has recommended this, stating that strong encryption will help protect everyone’s online security and possibly even “limit repressive regimes’ willingness to demand access to encrypted information.” Upholding encryption will also ensure that companies are able to offer new and innovative products and services.</p>
         <p>We demand safety, security, and integrity of our communications and systems. As a public, we should know—not hope—that the online services and encryption we use haven’t been weakened or compromised at the government’s request. No legislation, executive order, or private agreement with the government should undermine our rights.</p>
         <p>Weakening encryption weakens the entire web. Mr. President, please defend strong encryption, and encourage other world leaders to do the same.</p>
