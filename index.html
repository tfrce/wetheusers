          <h2>What this is:</h2>
          <p>
            Certain members of Congress and the NSA want to force companies to
            give the government special access to our data—such as by building
            security vulnerabilities into their products or giving the
            government the keys to unlock our encrypted data. These “backdoors”
            are ostensibly to help fight crime, but security experts worldwide
            agree that they’ll make the web less safe for all of us.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not possible to weaken encryption or create secret backdoors
            for law enforcement without making those same vulnerabilities
            available to bad actors. These proposals jeopardize not just our
            private data, but the security of every technology that relies on
            data encryption—everything from hospital equipment to airplane
            navigation systems to ATMs.
          </p>
          <p>
            One voice could tilt the balance and convince Congress and the
            intelligence community that real security standards can't be
            compromised: President Obama.
          </p>
          <p>
            Help us convince President Obama to speak out for real encryption.

          <p class="featured">
            <strong>Dear President Obama,</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Our safety and privacy depend on secure communications tools and
            technologies, like encryption. Encryption protects our
            conversations and our transactions. In some cases, it even saves
            lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            We urge you to publicly affirm your support for strong encryption,
            and reject any law or policy that would undermine our security.
            Please disavow legislation and other compulsory actions that would
            weaken encryption in order to compel government access to our
            private data. The government should not erode the security of our
            devices or applications, force companies to build secret security
            flaws or backdoors into their products, or access the keys to
            private data.
          </p>

          <p>
            The President’s own National Security Council has recommended
            this, stating that strong encryption will help protect everyone’s
            online security and possibly even “limit repressive regimes’
            willingness to demand access to encrypted information.” Upholding
            encryption will also ensure that companies are able to offer new
            and innovative products and services.
          </p>

          <p>
            We demand safety, security, and integrity of our communications
            and systems. As a public, we should know—not hope—that the online
            services and encryption we use haven’t been weakened or compromised
            at the government’s request. No legislation, executive order, or
            private agreement with the government should undermine our rights.
          </p>

          <p>
            Weakening encryption weakens the entire web. Mr. President, please
            defend strong encryption, and encourage other world leaders to do
            the same.
